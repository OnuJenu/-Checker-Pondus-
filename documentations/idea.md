Project Overview
The Two-Choice Voting Application is a scalable platform that enables users to participate in binary voting scenarios, such as yes/no questions or choosing between two media options (e.g., top image vs. bottom image). The application supports various media formats—including text, images, videos, and audio—to enhance user engagement through interactivity and real-time feedback.

Workflow Sequence
User Registration and Authentication

Users register or log in via the UserModule.
Authentication is secured using OAuth2 and JWT tokens.
Poll Creation

Authenticated users create new polls using the PollModule.
Polls may include a title, question, and two choices with various media types.
Adding Choices

Choices are added to polls via the ChoiceOptionModule.
Each choice can include media content and descriptions for accessibility.
Voting

Users browse and interact with polls through the QuestionBoardModule.
Votes are cast using the VoteModule, which records the user's choice and ensures one vote per poll.
Real-Time Updates

The PollConsumerModule provides real-time updates on poll results via WebSocket connections.
Users receive instant feedback on voting outcomes.
Background Processing

The BackgroundTasksModule handles tasks like updating statistics and sending notifications using Celery and Redis.
Scalability and Modularity
Modular Architecture: Each functionality is encapsulated within its own module, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

Real-Time Performance: Utilizes Django Channels and Redis for real-time interactions and caching, enhancing user experience during high traffic.

Media Handling: Media content is securely stored and managed using Amazon S3, supporting efficient retrieval and storage of various media types.

Asynchronous Processing: Background tasks are managed asynchronously with Celery and Redis, preventing blocking operations and ensuring smooth performance.

Future Expansion Considerations
User Segmentation and Recommendations

Implement algorithms to recommend polls to users based on their interests and previous interactions to increase engagement.
Enhanced Media Support

Expand support for richer media types and combinations, such as interactive media or augmented reality content.
Scalable Deployment Strategies

Utilize containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for deployment in cloud environments, ensuring the system can scale with demand.
